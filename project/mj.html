        <h2 class="size">About</h2>
        <p class="size">Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 â€“ June 25, 2009) was an American singer,
            songwriter, and
            dancer.
            Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the
            20th century.
            Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his
            publicized personal
            life,
            made him a global figure in popular culture.
            Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he
            popularized
            complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the "robot".
            He is the most awarded individual music artist in history. He was the 8th child in the jackson
            family which
            consisted of 10 children :)</p>
        <h2 class="size">Blog</h2>
        <p class="size">Michael Jackson was one of the main reason behind the development of American Pop music as it is
            now. A 5 year old kid, along with his brothers
            and an entertainment background, entered the field of music. No one knew that this tiny hatchling's gonna
            become an immortal phoenix in the pop
            culture. His first solo entry, "Got to be there" hit the US billboard top 100. Not an achievement that comes
            just by crude luck and few supporters.
            This very man flipped the way music and dance was seen. Music, which was limited to troops and recordings,
            also spread to DVDs, TV commertials and
            live broadcasts. Not only the perspective of how music was delivered changed, but also the wide audience who
            listened to it. Many fellow music lovers,
            across different nations listened to the creations of this legend. Michael Jackson is still popular among
            Indians till date. Many new bands and artists
            may come and go, but this man left a unique mark of his own in history through his music and dancing styles.

        <p class="size">Thriller was one of the best among best of songs in the 20th century pop culture.
            Being in the Top 200 of <i>"The Billboard"</i>, backed up by two other fan favorites <i>"Billie
                Jean"</i> and
            <i>"Beat it",
                this song was literally on every radio and tv of that time.
                Every night was enjoyable coz <b><i>"It's the THRILLER!!!....... Thriller Night!!!"</i></b>

        <h3>The way you make me feel</h3>

        <p class="size">Well well well....... are you into the 20th pop?
            And are you a fan of love tracks or anything that hypes the mood?
            Then this song is the perfect one. "The way you make me feel", as the name suggests... is a love
            song sung by this
            legend.
            This song was a part of the album "Bad", but proved to be a flaming song among couples for
            sometime.
            And as expected, this song was also among the top 100 in the billboard for a considerable time
            period.
            This song also featured his sister "Loyota Jackson".
            Well no song had "the way this made me feel" </p>
        <h3>Billie Jean</h3>
        <img src="images/Billie Jean.png" alt="Billie jean" class="centre" style="background-color: #191970;">
        <br>
        <audio src="MJ album/Michael Jackson - Bille Jean.mp3" controls class="centre"></audio>
        <p class="size"> Hmm... Nope! This ain't about Billy who lost his pair of jeans.
            Billie Jean is another product by the legend.
            The plot revolves around Michael being cheated by a girl named "Bille Jean" whom he met at a
            night party and got
            lured into her room.
            She then accuses Michael for sufferings and claims him to be her baby's father. But Michael
            later realizes all
            these
            were just the outcome of her masterplan! Poor Michael then roams around the street hopeless and
            that is the
            beginning scene of the song,
            where Michael sings his fateful lore and weeps. OFC! "The Billie Jean's not my lover" too!"She's
            just a girl who
            claims that I AM THE ONE!!"
        </p>
        <h3>Smooth criminal</h3>
        <img src="images/Smooth Criminal.jpg" alt="Smooth Criminal" class="centre">
        <br>
        <audio src="MJ album/Michael Jackson - Smooth Criminal.mp3" controls class="centre"></audio>
        <p class="size">The apt title for the apt song, I must say! The song just literally pushed back
            several other songs
            and was at
            the
            top of the board within a few days of its release.
            Not only that, this song also has a reference to the CPR treatement given by the paramedics.
            During their training
            for CPR, the trainees are to perform CPR to a dummy named "Annie",
            and are also trained to ask "Annie! Are you okay?!", in order to check whether the victim is
            responsive and
            conscious.
            But by mistake, the paramedics are noted to call the real victim as "Annie" becaouse of their
            training and its
            after
            effects.
            Our Spring man also had CPR in his life. So.... he found this to be a great way for a lyric and
            also to pay
            respect
            to the hard working paramedics.
            Wait a minute..... OH MY GOD!!! Annie are you okay?! Would you tell us that you are okay?!
